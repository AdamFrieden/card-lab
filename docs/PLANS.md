## PLAN NOTES

### Demo App Goals
- Show that react and framer motion can achieve a good-enough UI interaction for the game
- Provide example scenes that demonstrate core behavior and components so we can test and iterate quickly and easily

### What We Have
 - Example Pack Opening with juicy animation
 - Basic Roster/Hand interaction example
 - Partial Village with baseline game behavior - showing critters, gear, builds, acorns, packs

### Next Up To Do
- Some way to demo and iterate on a core encounter loop
- Some way to demo and iterate on core game progression
- Break up into more reusable components - card from pack, hand, slot, village should be reusing as much as possible
- Build polished, modular components that can be composed

### Long Term Features To Scope Out
- Server-authoritative state and interactions
- SSO with Google
- Basic monetization example
- Leaderboard
- PvP with Matchmaking
